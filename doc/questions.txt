	* Income inequality: Would the inequality in income affect the whole country's economy?
	* Industrial distribution: The effect of industrial distribution on country's economy.

Education:

	* Gender equality: Would the ratio of girls to boys in primary and secondary education affect country's economy?
	* Literacy rate: Definitely it makes sense.
